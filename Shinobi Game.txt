Naruto Counterattack Shinobigame

-- Background Story --

-several years after Narutos death
-the world is not at peace, but the nations are
-one ruler, to rule them all, the Sekaikage
-high target of assasination attempts
-> find the best Shinobi to guard the sekaikage
-Finish the game by archieving the position of the bodyguard of the Sekaikage
-be the best Shinobi ingame!
-the AI is going to be hard and the game is going to be unfair!


-- Basics --

-each charakter makes counterattacks and counter-counterattacks
	-> applies the feeling of "battling"

-Arena System
	-> big town with an arena
	-> winning increases arena rating (or whatever), losing decreases it
	-> arena rating enables new stuff

-enemies have levels aswell

-reputation system
	-> your maincharacter has reputation
	-> gained by winning tournaments and other things

-team up with other shinobi
	-> reputation is needed, in order to make the other shinobi join your squad

-battles can accur in different setups
	-> 1v1
	-> 2v2
	-> 3v3 etc
	-> but also 1v2, 1v3, 2v3, 2v4 etc

-different weapontypes have different counterattacks
	-> "active" and "reactive/counterbased" weapons
	-> active weapons have higher effect when attacking enemies
	-> reactive weapons have higher effect when countering attacks

-changing your weapon infight is an essential need to win
	-> changeing weapons infight may trigger certain deductions

-minor questsystem
	-> helping people doing their shit may grant stuff or reputation


-- Character System --

-each character has a membership, enabling basic abilities and traits
	-> ... such as Uchia:	--> given basic fire jutsus
				--> higher affinity to fire jutsus
				--> maybe harder to gain reputation


-- Skill System --

-each character has a few basic abilities, depending on their membership
	-> learn new "basic/membership" skills while leveling up

-upgrading skills
	-> upgrade basic skills
	-> upgrade schools of skills
		--> e.g. not just fireball, but all the fire jutsus

-learn new skills by winning/finding jutsu scrolls (like narutos kage no bushin jutsu)
	-> crappy ones can be found/obtained by finding/doing quests
	-> good ones are available by gaining high arena rating (they still cost currency)
	-> tournaments grant scrolls aswell

-improve your weapon skill
	-> simple weapon affinity system
		--> higher effects on katana/shuriken etc
	-> high need to train more than just one weapontype
		--> fighting with different weapons is essential
	-> good weapons require high weapon skill

-counter system is the main feature of this game
	-> being attacked and attacking results counterattacks
		--> attack -> counterattack -> counter-counterattack -> counter-counter-counterattack
		--> have a variable amount of counterattacks each turn
		--> Fight Simulation:
			---> Shinobi A has (5) counterattacks per turn, Shinobi B only (2):
			---> A(5) attacks B(2)
			---> B(2) counterattacks [B(2) -> B(1)]
			---> A(5) counterattacks [A(5) -> A(4)]
			---> B(1) counterattacks [B(1) -> B(0)]
			---> A(4) counterattacks [A(4) -> A(3)]
			---> B cannot counterattack, thus the battleing sequence is over
			---> A STILL can counterattack a Shinobi C, until he has no counterattacks left
	-> distinguish physical attacks and magical attacks
		--> a magical attack results a magical counterattack
	-> counter "attacks" can be defensive aswell
		--> such as gaining a shield after being magical attacked, because the counterattacker cant use offensive magic at all
	-> distinguish magical attack types
		--> a magical windattack might be countered by a different counterattack than a magical fireattack


-- Weapon System --

-different weapon types have different attacks and counterattacks
	-> a kunai for example might have low damage, but a high amount of counterattacks
	-> a katana has high damage, but a low amount of counterattacks
		--> kunai is good for 1v2, katana is good for 1v1
		--> beginning with a kunai in a 1v2 and switching to a katana when your first enemy is defeated is a good choice

-different weapontypes also grant "basic" weapon skills
	-> by leveling your weapontype skill you will learn more weapon skills

-weapons can be coated with chakra, nature chakra or explosive tags once each turn

-- Reputation System --

-mainly determined by your Shinobi Level
	-> Kage > Jonin > Chounin > Genin
-accomplish your exam succesfully to get into a higher "tier"
-you can only compete exams when you have reached certain requirements
	-> Reputation, Level, total weapon type levels etc
-exams are executed in big areals
	-> get to the end of the areal to succede the exam
	-> get bonus points by defeating other studets at the end of the exam


-- Misc Ideas --

-wind is effective against barriers
-counterattack states are instant casts
-counterattack states can be removed
-classic turn based fighting system
-special improvements can be made before attacking aswell, also instant
	-> enchant your next attack with wind or lifesteal, attack bombs to shuriken
	-> executed by items, which have to be bought of found
-Genjutsus can be cancled by almost anyone
	-> the better the genjutsu caster, the harder it is to remove
